    summary: |
      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural networkâ€™s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

## About Me

Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I am a Ph.D. Student at IMDEA Software Institute advised by [Prof. Marco Guarnieri](https://mguarnieri.github.io/). Previously, I obtained my Msc in Computer Engineering from Sapienza University and in Winter 2022 I was an Intern at Qualcomm.

In this website I mainly share my learning journey and showcase some projects.
